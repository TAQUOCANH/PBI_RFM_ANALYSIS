## I. Introduction
### 1. Business question
<p>Sales representatives from regional sales offices have assigned sales territories in the United States, Canada, England, Australia, Germany, and France. Each regional office consists of several sales representatives and a team manager. In their daily sales activities, sales representatives use both laptops and Handheld PCs that run Microsoft® Windows CE. A typical work day for a sales representative starts with the representative dialing in to the regional office and downloading current data such as inventory, product, and promotional information. During customer visits, the sales representative takes orders on the laptop or Handheld PC. At the end of each day, the sales representative sets up appointments for the following day or week, checks the appointments of other representatives in the area for possible collaboration, and updates the contact list. The sales representative dials back into the regional office, sends updated information, and receives any new internal communications from the base office or regional office. The company currently uses Microsoft Outlook® for email.</p>
<p>The sales teams have identified the following requirements that will enable them to perform their jobs better:</p>
<p>Customer segmentation and profiling:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze customers based on their purchase behaviours: RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary value of a transaction)</li>
  <li>Who are the best customer across all product lines? With whom should the sales team focus its efforts for building long-term relationships?</li>
  <li>What products are popular and at what rate among customer group?</li>
</ul>
